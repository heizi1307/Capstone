Place file "input_value.txt" and "test.py" in the cgi-bin, because these two files are cgi relative.
And put rest file to the servers web file, which might be htdocs in XAMPP or /var/www/html in apache .etc
And will the test.py will write the user input to the file input_value.txt. Still need a neural network model to read the file and give the result to the website.
